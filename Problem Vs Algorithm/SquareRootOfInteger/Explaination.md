# Square Root of Integer

## Explaination

I use simple binary search to find out the square root of the integer. I am considering only integers when calculating mid . This automatically floors the answer

## Complexity

Since I am using the binary search, the time complexity will be O(log(n)) and space complexity will be O(1)
